== Discrete Global Grid Reference System Definitions

The following informative schema describes the expected response of the resource linked to by using the `[ogc-rel:dggrs-definition]` link relation
from the DGGRS description. This behavior is specified by the <<rc_core,Core requirements class>>.
An important objective for this schema is to support establishing authoritative registries of DGGRSs providing a URI for a DGGRS corresponding to a specific definition.

Note that this schema is preliminary, and a normative version may be defined in a later version of the OGC API - DGGS Standard
or by a future part of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 21.
The schema may change to support a better description of existing and new classes of DGGH.

The DGGRS definition consists of three main components:

* The definition of the hierarchy of discrete global grids (`dggh`), including any parameterization such as the spheroid or orientation, establishing both the topology as well as the geometry of every zone,
* The Zonal Identifier Reference System (`zirs`), with textual identifiers being mandatory while 64-bit integer identifiers (which support the <<rc_zone-uint64,64-bit integer zone list encoding requirements class>>) are optional,
* The sub-zone ordering (`subZoneOrder`), which allows for <<rc_data-retrieval,retrieving zone data>> using e.g., <<rc_data-json,DGGS-JSON>> at a <<rc_data-custom-depths,`zone-depth`>> other than 0 (the values of sub-zones can be provided as a 1D array of values with a pre-established association to sub-zones).

Whereas the ZIRS provides a mechanism to globally identify a single zone using a textual identifier (and alternatively using a 64-bit integer), the deterministic sub-zone order provides
a local indexing mechanism to address smaller regions within a particular zone. This local indexing mechanism enables the DGGS-optimized data encodings defined by the DGGS-JSON and DGGS-FG-JSON requirements classes.
The two mechanisms may potentially be related to each other, for example using the same space filling curve such as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve[Morton code (Z-order curve)], but do not need to be.
If defining a more optimal sub-zone order for a particular DGGRS is not practical, the ascending sort order of the sub-zone identifiers can be specified as a fallback,
based on either the ASCII character strings of the textual identifiers, or the 64-bit integer identifiers.

=== ISEA9R DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is for an axis-aligned and equal-area DGGH based on the https://doi.org/10.3138/27H7-8K88-4882-1752[Icosahedral Snyder Equal-Area (ISEA)] planar projection (see https://proj.org/en/9.4/operations/projections/isea.html[PROJ] and https://github.com/mocnik-science/geogrid/blob/master/src/main/java/org/giscience/utils/geogrid/projections/ISEAProjection.java[geogrid] for open-source implementations) using rhombuses with a refinement ratio of 9.
When the ISEA projection is rotated clockwise 60 degrees, sheared horizontally by a -60 degrees angle, and units are mapped to a 5x6 space, the zones become square and their edges are aligned with the CRS axes, while remaining equal area.
A https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[2D Tile Matrix Set] can also be defined in this transformed CRS, allowing for compatibility with https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html[OGC API - Tiles], https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=35326[WMTS] and traditional client and visualization software with no built-in DGGS functionality.
This transformed CRS distorts angles and distances more than the planar ISEA projection, but the topology, indexing, and surface geometry on the Earth model remains the same as in that planar ISEA projection.

While the ISEA projection is defined for an authalic sphere, this DGGRS assumes that when importing or exporting data referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid a conversion between geodetic and authalic latitude is performed.
This guarantees that all zones are exactly the same area on the surface of the ellipsoid.

NOTE: The authalic (meaning "area preserving") sphere is a sphere that has the same surface area as the oblate ellipsoid being used.

=== ISEA3H DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is for an ISEA3H DGGH, also based on the ISEA planar projection, with hexagonal and pentagonal zones, and a refinement ratio of 3, using a zone reference system based in part on its dual relationship with the ISEA9R DGGH.
The DGGH is considered equal area, although each of the 12 pentagonal zones at any level occupies 5/6th of the area of a hexagonal zone at the same level.

The sub-zone ordering for this DGGRS is based on scanlines of tightly packed hexagons, sharing whole edges
with the previous and next zone within a scanline, while each zone shares two edges with the
previous scanline, and another two edges with the next scanline. The scanlines start on a vertex of the parent zone
for an even relative depth, while they start on an edge for an odd relative depth.

=== GNOSIS Global Grid DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is based on the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#toc58[variable width 2D Tile Matrix Set of the same name].
The GNOSIS Global Grid is also axis-aligned, with the axes being the geographic latitude and longitude, and already corresponds to a registered 2DTMS.
Through the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#variable-matrixwidth-tile-matrix[variable width capability] of the tile matrices, this DGGH approximates equal area.
For example, at any refinement level, only 4 zones touch each pole.
Since the error budget still exceeds the 1%, it cannot be considered equal area per the https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-040r3/20-040r3.html#toc28[OGC Topic 21 DGGS Equal Area Earth Reference System Package].
However, this divergence from the mean zone area is the same along a particular row of zones following latitude lines, and can easily be calculated and taken into consideration.
Since its native axes are latitude and longitude, no additional reprojection is required to import data to or export data from this DGGH.
