== Examples
This annex provides a set of examples illustrating requests and responses for retrieving DGGS <<rc_data-retrieval,zone data>> and performing <<rc_zone-query,zone queries>> using capabilities defined by this DGGS API.

=== Collection description
DGGS resources can be attached to an https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html[_OGC API - Common - Part 2_] collection origin.
The following global GEBCO 2014 bathymetry collection will be used as an example:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco?f=json[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco]

An example JSON response for this collection description resource, as defined by Common - Part 2 and the <<rc_collection-dggs, Collection DGGS Requirement Class>>, is presented below, including a link to the list of available DGGRSs:

=== Listing available DGGRSs
Whether accessing DGGS resources for the root of an API/dataset or for a particular collection, the first DGGS-specific request made by a client would be to list the available DGGRSs.
Following the link obtained from the previous example response, a client can determine which DGGRSs are supported by the API at that end-point:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs?f=json[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs]

An example JSON response for this DGGRS list, as defined by the <<rc_core,Core requirement class>>, is presented below:

=== Retrieving the description of a specific DGGRS
A client would then select a particular DGGRS of which it already has built-in knowledge, possibly using a software library implementing support for one or more DGGRS available from the server.

IMPORTANT: This DGGS API is intended primarily for client / server exchanges where both parties are familiar and can efficiently deal with the same DGGRS.
Use cases where the client itself also acts as a server as part of data integration workflows are particularly relevant, where the combination of
advanced spatial queries with the ability to request data for specific zones of interest can potentially greatly accelerate analytic processing
through parallel distributed processing and lazy evaluation.

As a fallback, a client without native support for a particular DGGRS can still retrieve and interpret data from a server implementing support for both
zone queries and data retrieval by performing a two-steps operation. First, the client can perform a zone query for an area of interest using the `bbox` query parameter.
Then, the client can request data for the zones returned by this query in a georeferenced encoding which it understands and which is not tightly coupled with the DGGRS (excluding e.g.,the <<rc_data-json,DGGS-JSON>> encoding), such as GeoJSON or GeoTIFF.
However, for such use cases, OGC API - DGGS does not present significant advantages over other OGC API data access mechanisms such as
https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-087.html[OGC API - Coverages], https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html[OGC API - Features] or https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html[OGC API - Tiles].

In this example, the client selects the <<isea3h-dggrs,ISEA3H DGGRS>> (because it has built-in support for it) and follows the link to obtain a complete description of the DGGRS:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H?f=json[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H]

An example JSON response for this DGGRS description, as defined by the <<rc_core,Core requirement class>>, is presented below.
Note how the description is more comprehensive than the summary description included for each item in the previous DGGRS list response, including a description,
a default (relative) depth as well as additional links and link templates.

See the informative <<annex-dggrs-def,annex B>> for examples of DGGRS definition responses which the client could obtain by following the `[ogc-rel:dggrs-definition]` links.
The annex includes provisionary definitions for the <<isea3h-dggrs,ISEA3H>>, <<isea9r-dggrs,ISEA9R>> and <<ggg-dggrs,GNOSIS Global Grid>> used in these examples
which will likely be used to initially populate an authoritative registry, Additional DGGRS entries would be submitted, reviewed and registered based on the needs of the community.

=== Retrieving information for a specific DGGRS zone

Later examples will demonstrate how to list available zones by performing zone queries, but for now these examples will skip directly to <<zone-info,retrieving information about a particular zone>>.
This capability, also defined in the Core requirement class, exists primarily for completeness of the API resource tree, for allowing to explore datasets using a browser interface,
as well as for educational, demonstration and debugging purposes.
An actual DGGS API client for visualization or performing analytics would normally not access this resource at all, since URL templates allow to directly access the data for a particular zone.
While the Core requirement class makes a number of recommendations about statistical information and topological relationships that should be included in the zone information resource,
clients may not rely on any of this information being present. Clients can instead rely on their own local software libraries to establish topological relationships, can use zone queries
to pose questions that can be answered by a list of zone IDs, or can retrieve zone data packets containing values from multiple sub-zones to perform their own analytics.
A future extension could also introduce mandatory requirements making some of the recommended content such as summary statistics or additional useful information mandatory, which clients could then rely on
for conforming implementations.

This example assumes a client does for some reason request information in a JSON representation about a particular ISEA3H DGGRS zone, say `E6-317-A`, based on its built-in support for that DGGRS
(perhaps this client is an Executable Test Suite, since implementing this resource is still required to conform to the Core conformance class,
including at minimum an `id` and links to the DGGRS and data retrieval, if applicable).
The GET request URL and response for this zone information resource associated with the GEBCO collection would then look like the following:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/E6-317-A?f=json[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/E6-317-A]

An HTML representation of that zone information resource, allowing a user to browse through parent, children and neighboring zones,
could look like the following:

=== Simple zone queries
Having selected a particular DGGRS, one use case for the API is for a client to perform spatial queries by <<rc_zone-query,requesting a list of zones>>.
The simplest case is to simply request a list of all available zones for a discrete global grid of a given refinement level (`zone-level`), which in the case of a particular collection implies zones
for which the collection has data.

==== Querying a particular refinement level

If no `zone-level` parameter is provided, the server is free to pick a default zone level for such queries, which would result in a reasonable number of zones returned,
based on the area and resolution of the data collection. In this example, the client will explicitly request a list of zones at refinement level 1.

By default, if `compact-zones=false` is not specified by the client, zone queries are compacted, meaning that
if all sub-zones of a parent zone would be included in the response, they get replaced by that parent zone so that fewer zones need to be enumerated.
This can result in zones of a lower refinement level being returned than the requested `zone-level`, and therefore a mix of zones of different levels.
A full globe response would thereore always result in the list of all zones of refinement level 0.
In these examples, the client will explicitly set `compact-zones=false`.

Following the `[ogc-rel:dggrs-zone-query]` link, specifying these parameters, and negotiating a <<rc_table-zone_json,JSON zone list>> response using an `Accept: application/json` header, the client requests from the end-point:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&zone-level=1&compact-zones=false[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?zone-level=1&compact-zones=false]

An example JSON response for this Zone Query JSON, as defined by the <<rc_zone-query,Zone Query requirement class>>, is presented below:

      }
   ]
}
----

The server returned all 32 zones of ISEA3H level 1 (which corresponds to a truncated icosahedron -- the traditional soccer ball pattern), because the collection has global coverage.

Servers may support additional representations of zone lists beyond JSON, such as a more compact <<rc_zone-binary64bit,binary 64-bit integers>> encoding, a <<rc_zone-geojson,GeoJSON representation>> including zone geometry
or an <<rc_zone-html,HTML representation>> for exploring datasets in a browser through the DGGS API.
Note that regardless of encoding, zone query responses can also be compressed for additional banwidth efficiency if the client and server negotiate a content encoding e.g., using `Content-Encoding: gzip`.

CAUTION: The transfer of zone geometry in zone queries is not an efficient use of the DGGS API for practical analytics purposes, since clients should already have built-in knowledge of the selected DGGRS
in their local software libraries and can efficiently infer the geometry of a zone from its zone ID alone as needed. In many use cases, the geometry may not be needed at all.

The ability to retrieve zone lists in a geospatial data format such as GeoJSON or <<rc_zone-geotiff,GeoTIFF>> which can readily be visualized in GIS tools is useful for **educational**, **demonstration** and **debugging** purposes.
For example, this functionality can be used to generate grids, such as those seen in <<annex-dggrs-def,annex B>> (a `crs` parameter to request an ISEA planar projection was used in that case to override the default GeoJSON CRS84),
as well as the zone visualizations seen in the examples in this section.

A visualization of the response from negotiating `application/geo+json` for the above request is seen below.

==== Querying for a spatio-temporal subset

To request a list of zones for an area of interest, the `bbox` or `subset` query parameter can be used.
For temporal datasets, the `datetime` can be used as well as `subset=time(...)` to constrain the query to a time of interest.
For restricting the same zone query to a bounding box area from (40°N, 30°E) to (60°N,50°E), the client could make either of the following requests:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&bbox=30,40,50,60&zone-level=1&compact-zones=false["\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?bbox=30,40,50,60&zone-level=1&compact-zones=false"]

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&subset=Lat(40:60),Lon(30:50)&zone-level=1&compact-zones=false["\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?subset=Lat(40:60),Lon(30:50)&zone-level=1&compact-zones=false"]

and obtain the following response (negotiating a JSON zone list again):

[%unnumbered%]

   "zones" : [ "A0-0-G", "A6-0-E" ],
   "returnedAreaMetersSquare" : 31137344609299.56640625,

   ],

        "uriTemplate" : "/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/{zoneId}/data",
      }
   ]
}
----

This time, the server returned only two zones of ISEA3H level 1.

A visualization of the response from negotiating `application/geo+json` for the above request, together with the bounding box used, is seen below.

[#img_zones_globe='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']

As seen below, an HTML representation could include rendered previews of the data for the zone area, summary information, as well as links to retrieve the data and access the zone information resource for each zone.
Note that the significant variance in area (-11.31% and +6.66% from the reference mean zone (whose area is calculated by dividing the Earth surface area by the total number of zones) is due to the the fact that `A0-0-G` is a pentagon (in the ISEA projection -- on the Earth surface it looks more like a decagon) which occupies 5/6th the
area of hexagons such as `A6-0-E` (which on the Earth surface is one of the hexagons appearing as a nonagon), as well as the fact that at level 1, the number of pentagons (12) is significant compared to the total number of zones (32).

Of course with a higher zone level, many more zones can be returned:

==== Zones representing data availability

The primary purpose of the <<rc_zone-query,Zone Query requirement class>> is to ask questions of the type _"Where is it?"_.
The answer is a region of space-time represented by a list of zones. This region might correspond to where data is available for a particular collection, may be the result of a processing workflow, or the
result of evaluating a CQL2 query expression as demonstrated in later examples. This result could otherwise have been communicated as a multi-polygon vector mask or as a rasterized 1-bit image or opacity channel.

The following example illustrates the case of a collection (elevation data from https://viewfinderpanoramas.org/[Viewfinder Panoramas]) which does not have data for everywhere on the globe (only over land), using a higher zone level of 6 for the query.

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&zone-level=6&compact-zones=false[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?zone-level=6&compact-zones=false]

image::images/zones-srtm-isea3h-level6.png[width=700,align="center"]

Using a bounding box to restrict the query to an area of interest, a higher zone level of 10 could be used:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&zone-level=10&bbox=30,40,50,50&compact-zones=false["\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?zone-level=10&bbox=30,40,50,50&compact-zones=false"]

image::images/zones-srtm-isea3h-level10-bbox.png[width=500,align="center"]

The DGGS API works independently of the nature of the data, whether dealing with gridded coverage or vector features, allowing to easily perform complex analytics involving heterogeneous data sources.
The previous examples all used gridded coverage data sources. The following example illustrates the same capabilities using the Natural Earth states and provinces collection:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/NaturalEarth:cultural:ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&zone-level=6&compact-zones=false[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/NaturalEarth:cultural:ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?zone-level=6&compact-zones=false]

image::images/zones-states-isea3h.png[width=700,align="center"]

The similarity between the response for this collection of states and provinces features compared to the same request earlier for a gridded elevation coverages showcases the potential for DGGS zone queries to facilitate data integration.

==== Querying sub-zones of a parent zone

The Zone Query requirement class defines the `parent-zone` query parameter as one more way how to restrict the query spatially (and temporally in the case of a temporal DGGRS), which is particularly useful for hierarchical exploration.
For example, to restrict the query to sub-zones of `A6-0-E` rather than using a bounding box, the client could perform the following request (at level 8):

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&zone-level=8&parent-zone=A6-0-E&compact-zones=false[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?zone-level=8&parent-zone=A6-0-E&compact-zones=false]

[#img_zones_srtm_l8_parent_zone='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.GeoJSON response for zone query for ISEA3H DGGRS at level 8, for parent zone https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/A6-0-E[A6-0-E], for a https://viewfinderpanoramas.org/[Viewfinder Panoramas] land elevation collection, visualized in QGIS
image::images/zones-srtm-isea3h-level8-parent-zone.png[width=500,align="center"]

The client could then pick one of the returned zones, say `E6-317-A`, for deeper exploration at level 16:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&zone-level=16&parent-zone=E6-317-A&compact-zones=false[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?zone-level=16&parent-zone=E6-317-A&compact-zones=false]

[#img_zones_srtm_l16_parent_zone='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']

image::images/zones-srtm-isea3h-level16-parent-zone.png[width=500,align="center"]

Going back to A6-0-E (a level 1 zone), this could also be used to retrieve the immediate children by requesting the next level (2), to step down the hierarchy a single refinement level at a time:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?f=json&zone-level=2&parent-zone=A6-0-E&compact-zones=false[\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA3H/zones?zone-level=2&parent-zone=A6-0-E&compact-zones=false]

The 7 children zones (1 centroid child and 6 vertex children) are returned, since they all contain data.

==== ISEA9R (rhombus) Zone Queries

Although all examples so far used the ISEA3H DGGRS, this DGGS API is completely agnostic of the DGGRS.
Future planned parts for OGC Abstract Topic 21 will standardize new categories of DGGS, including volumetric (Part 2), temporal (Part 3) and axis-aligned (Part 4).
The DGGS API functionality, as demonstrated in this examples section, is ready to handle all any DGGRS, including DGGRS based on these new DGGS types.

The following examples demonstrates equivalent zone queries using the <<isea9r-dggrs,ISEA9R DGGS>>, a dual DGGS of ISEA3H even refinement levels, which can be considered axis-aligned in a CRS derived from rotating and shearing the ISEA planar projection.
In the ISEA planar projection, the ISEA9R zones are shaped as rhombuses.

Although ISEA9R is axis-aligned, like ISEA3H, it is equal area, with an error budget below 1%.

==== GNOSIS Global Grid (WGS84 rectangles) Zone Queries

The next zone query examples use the <<ggg-dggrs,GNOSIS Global Grid DGGRS>>. The GNOSIS Global Grid is also axis-aligned, with the axes being the geographic latitude and longitude.
On a plate carée projection, the zones are shaped as rectangles, which conveniently correspond to typical EPSG:4326 / CRS84 bounding boxes.

=== Compact zone queries
The following examples are reprises of some of the earlier ones leaving compact zones enabled, showcasing the fewer zones being returned to communicate an identical spatial area.

==== ISEA3H compact zone queries
Compacting ISEA3H zones is complicated by the fact that sub-zones are not fully congruent.
The approach demonstrated here skips a refinement level, taking advantage of the fact that 7 of the grand-children of a zone are congruent. Overlaps are seen, as 6 holes
are left at the vertices of the grand-parent, each occupying 1/3rd the size of a congruent grand-child. Note how 7 + 6 x 1/3 = 9 (3 x 3), which corresponds to the two subsequent refinements at the refinement ratio of 3.
If the neighboring grand-parent of the same refinement level cannot be used, then the non-congruent vertex children must be included, resulting in these overlaps.

==== ISEA9R compact zone queries
Compacting ISEA9R zones can be achieved quite simply given that all sub-zones are fully congruent.

image::images/compact-srtm-isea9r-level8-parent-zone.png[width=600,align="center"]

==== GNOSIS Global Grid compact zone queries
Compacting GNOSIS Global Grid zones is also simple to achieve since sub-zones are also fully congruent.

To illustrate how the width of the zones attempts to remain equal to the height, the following examples are visualized using the world Mercator projection.
As with the previous examples for ISEA3H and ISEA9R, the zones of a given refinement level are filled with the same color.
Note that the zones closer to the poles are wider in longitude than zones closer to the equator, and can be seen in a 2-to-1 configuration at jumps in the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#variable-matrixwidth-tile-matrix[variable widths] coalescence factor such as at the 45° parallel,
but these zones still occupy a similar area within the error budget.
However, in these illustrations, the polar zones appear much larger than zones of the same level closer to the equator because the Mercator projection enlarges features away from the equator.

=== Filtering zone queries using CQL2 expressions
The Zone Query capabilities is most useful for use cases where the retrieved zone list is the result of some operation,
whether a processing workflow or the evaluation of a query expressed by the client.
The <<rc_zone-query-cql2-filter,CQL2 filter>> capability allows to express such queries using the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065r1.html[OGC Common Query Language (CQL2)].
Note that the processing workflow could also itself include CQL2 expressions using https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-009.html#section_fields_modifiers[input/output field modifiers].

The CQL2 requirement class in this standard specifically calls for the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065r1.html#cql2-text[CQL2-Text encoding], which is an intuitive representation with many similarities to SQL.
CQL2 defines minimum capabilities (https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065r1.html#cql2-core[Basic CQL2]) as well as additional optional capabilities, such as
https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065r1.html#arithmetic[arithmetic operations] and https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065r1.html#spatial-functions[spatial relation functions].
The API implementation's conformance resource (`/conformance` as defined in https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html[OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core] "Landing Page" requirement class) would allow the client
to know which capabilities are supported.

Basic CQL2 includes support for logical operators as well as to compare the value of queryables against literals using relational operators.
The following examples will use the GEBCO collection from earlier ones to illustrate these capabilities.
The previous simple zone queries using this collection were not particuarly interesting since it covers the entire globe,
but the use of CQL2 will enable the use of its data values.
First, the client would retrieve the queryables by following the `[ogc-rel:queryables]` link from the collection description:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/queryables?f=json[https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/queryables]

The `application/schema+json` response would look like so:

[%unnumbered%]
[source,json]
----
{
   "$schema" : "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
   "$id" : "https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/queryables",
   "title" : "General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans",
   "type" : "object",
   "properties" : {
      "Elevation" :
      {
         "type" : "number",
         "x-ogc-propertySeq" : 1,
         "x-ogc-definition": "https://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/Altitude",
         "x-ogc-unit": "m"
      },
      "rec.geom" : {
         "x-ogc-role" : "primary-geometry",
         "format" : "geometry-point"
      }
   }
}
----

This informs the client that an `Elevation` queryable is available for use in CQL2 expressions.
Although this collection is a gridded coverage, a `rec.geom` queryable is still included in the schema which represents the geometry of each individual grid cell.
Since the value associated with these cells represent a point in this collection, the format indicates `geometry-point`. Later examples will make use of this `rec.geom` property.

The client could then submit the following zone query to return only zones where elevation is below sea level (`Elevation < 0`), at refinement level 6:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?filter=Elevation<0&zone-level=6&f=json["\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?filter=Elevation < 0&zone-level=6"]

The following image is a visualization of the list of zones returned.

image::images/cql2-gebco-elevation.png[width=700,align="center"]

The client could request instead for deeper elevations e.g., `Elevation < -4000`:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?filter=Elevation%20<%20-4000&zone-level=6&f=json["\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?filter=Elevation < -4000&zone-level=6"]

or for high elevations e.g., `Elevation > 3000`:

or for either deep or high elevations e.g., `Elevation < -4000 or Elevation > 3000`:

image::images/cql2-gebco-elevation-high-or-deep.png[width=700,align="center"]

This last visualization higlights the fact that the Andes and Antarctica mountains are actually very close to very deep sea.

If the implementation support spatial relation functions, a query could test intersection with a geometry, which can be expressed using a WKT literal in CQL2-Text.
The following example returns zones intersecting the Bermuda Triangle, making use of the `rec.geom` queryable, which represents the geometry of the individual coverage grid cells, mentioned earlier, at refinement level 9.

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?zone-level=9&filter=S_INTERSECTS(rec.geom,POLYGON((-64.8%2032.3,-65.5%2018.3,-80.3%2025.2,-64.8%2032.3)))&f=json["\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?zone-level=9&filter=S_INTERSECTS(rec.geom,POLYGON((-64.8 32.3,-65.5 18.3,-80.3 25.2,-64.8 32.3)))"]

image::images/cql2-polygon-l9.png[width=600,align="center"]

This spatial filter could also be combined together with a relational operator as in the following query for `Elevation < -5500` within the Bermuda Triangle:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?zone-level=11&filter=Elevation%20<%20-5500%20and%20S_INTERSECTS(rec.geom,POLYGON((-64.8%2032.3,-65.5%2018.3,-80.3%2025.2,-64.8%2032.3)))&f=json["\https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/isea3h/zones?zone-level=11&filter=Elevation < -5500 and S_INTERSECTS(rec.geom,POLYGON((-64.8 32.3,-65.5 18.3,-80.3 25.2,-64.8 32.3)))"]

image::images/cql2-5500-depth-bermuda-l11.png[width=500,align="center"]

To illustrate the use of CQL2 arithmetic operators, the following example will use a collection of daily climate CMIP5 data from the https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip5-daily-single-levels[Copernicus Climate Data Store].
The request will be for zones where the difference between two different fields of the coverage, the maximum (`tasmax`) and minimum (`tasmin`) daily near-surface air temperature, is greater than 10 degrees Kelvin.
In addition, this request will use the `datetime` parameter to subset the temporal dimension for June 1, 2023.

image::images/cql2-tas-delta.png[width=700,align="center"]

CQL2 expressions can also be used for queries using attributes of vector features.
The following examples use a collection of building polygon features in Ottawa extracted from the OpenStreetMap dataset, filtering buildings using both a spatial subset and the `name` attribute of the features.

This first example illustrates querying for the National Arts Centre at ISEA3H level 30:

=== Retrieving data for a DGGRS Zone

Data can be retrieved for a parent zone of interest, including values for all sub-zones within it, at the `.../dggs/{dggrsId}/zones/{zoneId}/data` resource path.

The following examples illustrate this capability for different DGGRSs, representation encodings, CRSs, and other parameters.

==== Retrieving data from an ISEA3H DGGRS

Examples in this section retrieve data for pentagonal and hexagonal zones of an <<isea3h-dggrs, ISEA3H DGGRS>>, based on the ISEA projection.

This first example retrieves elevation data for the GEBCO collection for ISEA3H zone `A2-0-A` at a relative depth of 8.
The default zone depth is 10 for this DGGRS in this particular deployment of the API, as specified in the `defaultDepth` property of the <<isea3h-dggs-description-response,ISEA3H DGGRS description response>>).
These requests override this default by using the `zone-depth` parameter defined in the <<rc_data-custom-depths,"Data Custom Depths">> requirement class.

===== DGGS-JSON Examples

A snippet of the DGGS-JSON response follows, including an array of elevation values ordered as per the <<isea3h_order_vertex,deterministic zone order defined by this ISEA3H DGGRS>>.

===== GeoTIFF Examples

In a https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/A2-0-A/data?zone-depth=8&f=geotiff[GeoTIFF representation], rather than being quantized to sub-zones, the Elevation would be quantized to the closest rectilinear gridded coverage cells, at a resolution high enough to include at least
one value per corresponding sub-zones. The data may still be clipped to the shape of the zone geometry.
By default, this implementation returns the data in an OGC:CRS84 CRS.

image::images/tiff-zoneDataWGS84.png[width=700,align="center"]

Visualizing this data on 3D globe would look like the following image.

Alternatively, the implementation also supports the `crs` parameter to select the https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/A2-0-A/data?zone-depth=8&f=geotiff&crs=%5BOGC:1534%5D[ISEA planar projection as an alternate CRS].
In this CRS, this pentagonal zone spans the interruption between two triangles of the base icosahedron.

.Visualization of an ISEA planar projection GeoTIFF response for retrieving data for pentagonal ISEA3H DGGRS zone https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/A2-0-A[A2-0-A] of https://www.gebco.net/news_and_media/gebco_2014_grid.html[GEBCO 2014 bathymetry] at a relative depth of 8
image::images/tiff-zoneDataISEA.png[width=600,align="center"]

A major inconvenience of the ISEA planar projection is that hexagonal zones further along the interruptions will be split on each side on the interruption,
resulting in a large separation between the two halves of the data, as illustrated for example with zone C2-4-A.

image::images/tiff-ISEA-splitHex.png[width=750,align="center"]

On the other hand, a hexagon not spanning an interruption will appear in the ISEA planar projection as typical hexagons with two edges aligned with either the horizontal (for odd parent zone levels) or vertical axis (for even levels).

Whereas DGGS-JSON and GeoTIFF are encodings appropriate for raster data, with DGGS-JSON better suited for representing values quantized to the hierarchical discrete global grids,
using these formats for encoding vector data essentially implies rasterizing the vector features, using either a selection of the feature properties as values, or using numerical feature identifier
for which associated properties may be queryable elsewhere (e.g., in an http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0.1[OGC API - Features] deployment).

===== GeoJSON Examples

Although gridded elevation and bathymetry data is better suited to these previous formats for raster data, a GeoJSON and/or Features & Geometry JSON representation
could also be offered where each zone is represented as a feature, with the associated property providing the data values such as the elevation.
This would be equivalent to the <<rc_zone-geojson,GeoJSON representation for a zone list>> where `compact-zones` is set to `false`, the `parent-zone` is the zone for which data is requested,
and the `zone-level` is the sum of the parent zone plus the relative zone depth at which data is requested (the default depth or `zone-depth` parameter), with the addition of these
properties associating data values with each zone.

If the geometry for these zone features is provided as polygons (`geometry=zone-region`), visualizing this vector data would produce an output like the following partial response,
which would result in a visualization identical to <<img_zone_data>>.

For data of a vector nature, a vector format such as GeoJSON allows to encode zone data response in a more compact manner without having to rasterize the data.
Ideally, especially for features spanning a large spatial extent (such as country boundaries, or the coastline of a large landmass), the features would be clipped to the geometry of the zone for which data
is being requested, or as least to limited extent around the zone.
Unfortunately, GeoJSON and FG-JSON do not yet have a standard mechanism to identify artificial edges which may result from such clipping.
This complicates re-joining features spread across multiple zones, and may result in rendering artifacts for polygonal features when rendered with a stroke,
as the stroke would also be drawn on those artificial segments at the bound edges.

The following response for a zone data request and its visualization illustrates vector features in Ottawa from OpenStreetMap returned as GeoJSON.
The features and geometry coordinates in this case have no relation to sub-zones, and are only clipped to the zone for which data is being requested.
The zone depth (default zone depth of 10 in this case) can however control cartographic generalization of the geometry.
This could potentially include filtering point features, based on rules associated with the dataset, as decided by the implementation, as well as the precision of the coordinates.

===== DGGS-FG-JSON Examples

The DGGS-FG-JSON format is the vector counterpart to DGGS-JSON, leveraging the same concepts of DGGRS, parent zone, sub-zones at a given relative depth, and deterministic sub-zone order,
while also building on top of the familiar Features & Geometry JSON and GeoJSON formats, which are themselves built on OGC Simple Features.

In DGGS-FG-JSON, spatial coordinates of the feature geometries corresponding to the spatial dimensions of the DGGRS are encoded as integer sub-zone order indices ranging from 1 to the
number of sub-zones at the selected relative depth. This relative depth corresponds to the precision of the coordinates at which geometry is being defined, analogous to the number of decimals
that would be used in GeoJSON or FG-JSON. Because this essentially corresponds to a coordinate system local to the zone for which data is being retrieved, high precision can be achieved
with much fewer information than is required to address the entire globe.

This representation also addresses the issue of artificial segments, by using a special zone order index value of _0_ for representing coordinates outside of the zone,
which facilitates merging geometry across adjacent zones and easily identifying artificial segments of polygon contours.
For polygons, rather than tracing points along the clipping zone edge(s), only the exit and entry points will exist with a single _0_ coordinate value in between, indicating that the portion of the zone
edge(s) between those two points is within the contour. A DGGS-FG-JSON representation is requested using the `application/fg+json` media type together with the `geometry=quantized` query parameter.

The DGGS-FG-JSON representation for the previous OpenStreetMap example extract follows, at a relative depth precision of 15,
resulting in coordinates within a ~275 cm² region, ~16 cm precision, with sub-zone indices between 1 and 14,355,469 (roughly equivalent to latitude and longitude with six decimal places).

===== GeoTIFF Examples

The following illustrates the GeoTIFF response for requesting data from the same A2-0 ISEA9R zone at same relative depth of 4 in three different CRSs:
https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA9R/zones/A2-0/data?zone-depth=4&f=tiff&crs=%5BOGC:153456%5D[5x6 ISEA rotated and sheared space],
https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA9R/zones/A2-0/data?zone-depth=4&f=tiff&crs=%5BOGC:1534%5D[ISEA planar projection], and
https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA9R/zones/A2-0/data?zone-depth=4&f=tiff&crs=%5BOGC:CRS84%5D[CRS84].

.Visualization in the ISEA 5x6 rotated and shared space of a GeoTIFF response for retrieving data for ISEA9R DGGRS zone https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA9R/zones/A2-0[A2-0] of https://www.gebco.net/news_and_media/gebco_2014_grid.html[GEBCO 2014 bathymetry] at a relative depth of 4
image::images/isea9r-gebco-tiff-5x6.png[width=600,align="center"]

TIP: Because ISEA9R zone edges are fully aligned with the axes of the ISEA 5x6 rotated and sheared space and the rhombic zones are square in this space,
a GeoTIFF representation provides a one-to-one mapping of zones to rectilinear gridded coverage cells, as can be seen by comparing this previous visualization of the GeoTIFF response with the visualization of the DGGS-JSON responses.
For the same reason, https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/tileMatrixSets/ISEA9R[an ISEA9R] https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[2D Tile Matrix Set] can be defined in this 5x6 space, which supports using
https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html[OGC API - Tiles] as an alternative or complementary access mechanism to the Zone Data Retrieval requirements class of this DGGS API.

image::images/isea9r-gebco-tiff-crs84.png[width=700,align="center"]

TIP: In these two previous visualizations, the server returned a response in the ISEA planar projection and CRS84, respectively.
If the affine transformation from the ISEA 5x6 rotated and sheared space is done on the client side instead, the rhombic shape of the individual sub-zones would be preserved, as in the corresponding visualizations
of the DGGS-JSON representation.

Using centroid points for the geometry of each zone (`geometry=zone-centroid`), the GeoJSON response and associated visualization would look like the following:

==== Retrieving data from a GNOSIS Global Grid DGGRS

Examples in this section retrieve data for rectangular zones of a <<ggg-dggrs, GNOSIS Global Grid DGGRS>>, with edges aligned to the geographic latitude and longitude axes.

===== DGGS-JSON Examples

The following request is for data from the 0-1-3 level 0 GNOSIS Global Grid zone in DGGS-JSON at a relative depth of 7:

image::images/ggg-gebco-crs84.png[width=700,align="center"]

TIP: Notice how there are fewer zones per rows approaching the poles, until there is a single zone at the final polar row.
While not achieving the 1% error budget allowed for a DGGH to qualify as being equal area, the use of the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#variable-matrixwidth-tile-matrix[Variable Width 2D Tile Matrix Set] concept allows
the GNOSIS Global Grid to maintain a divergence in area from mean zone surface area below 50% up to a high refinement level, with zones aligned to the geodetic latitude and longitude axes.
This in turn greatly facilitates data integration from other discrete global grid hierarchies as well as arbitrary data sources, as no re-projection is needed for WGS84 coordinates.

image::images/ggg-gebco-tiff-crs84.png[width=600,align="center"]

TIP: As can be seen by comparing this previous visualization of the GeoTIFF response with the visualization of the DGGS-JSON responses,
because the GNOSIS Global Grid zone edges are fully aligned with geographic latitude and longitude, a GeoTIFF representation provides a one-to-one mapping of zones to rectilinear gridded coverage cells,
with the exception of the GeoTIFF representation having a fixed width, requiring to duplicate the values of zones approaching the pole.

TIP: A registered https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#toc58[GNOSIS Global Grid 2D Tile Matrix Set] is defined which supports using
https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html[OGC API - Tiles] as an alternative or complementary access mechanism to the Zone Data Retrieval requirements class of this DGGS API.

=== Subsetting and filtering zone data

In addition to the basic retrieval of zone data, implementations can support additional parameters for the `.../zones/{zoneId}/data` resources to return only a portion of the data associated with the zone.
The `subset`, `datetime` and `properties` query parameters are defined in the <<rc_data-subsetting,Data Subsetting>> requirement class, while the `filter` query parameter is defined in the <<rc_data-cql2-filter, Filtering Zone Data with CQL2>> requirement class.

==== Temporal subsetting

It is possible to retrieve only a portion of a temporal datasets using one of two query parameters: `datetime`, or `subset` with the `time` dimension.
The temporal subset can be either a slice specified using a single time instant, or a trim using a lower and upper bound.

The following examples retrieve data from a sentinel-2 collection for the 28th of April, May and June 2022, at relative depth of 12, for ISEA3H zone E7-17D1-A in New Zealand.
Since the sentinel-2 dataset does not have imagery for the whole globe at every instant, the server will return the latest imagery available before the specified time instant.

TIP: Temporal subsetting for a slice can also be achieved using the equivalent `subset=time("2022-10-06":"2022-10-10")` syntax for trimming, and `subset=time("2022-10-06")` for slicing.

==== Subsetting arbitrary dimensions

In addition to spatial and temporal dimensions, datasets may be comprised of additional dimensions, such as atmospheric pressure.
These dimensions can also be subset in a similar manner using the `subset` parameter.

TIP: Although the examples illustrated here are all for rasterized data, field selection can also be applied to feature collection outputs so select which properties to include.

==== Filtering zone data using CQL2 expressions

The `filter` query parameter can be used to only include data matching a CQL2 expression, which can reference the queryables of the collections, such as the feature properties or fields.

In a DGGS-JSON output, sub-zones which are not a match get replaced by a `null` value. In a GeoTIFF output, pixel values get replaced by a NODATA value.

Although the examples illustrated here are all for rasterized data, a CQL2 expression filter can also be applied to feature collections to select which feature to include in the output.

When retrieving a temporal slice with a filter, the server may fill in the filtered out sub-zones with earlier imagery not excluded by the filter.
This can be used for example to replace cloudy sub-zones with the closest earlier cloud-free imagery.
