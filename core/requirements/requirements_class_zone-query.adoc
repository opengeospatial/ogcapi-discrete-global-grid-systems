The following recommendation describes how the response should include the total surface area of the zones returned from the query (or volume / hypervolume in the case of spatiotemporal and/or 3D DGGS),
excluding overlapping regions when returning compact zones.

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-query/zone-total-area
description:: For returning the total area (or volumes) occupied by zones returned by the query
part:: The Implementation SHOULD indicate the total surface area (in the case of a 2D DGGS) or total (hyper)volume occupied (in the case of a 3D or 4D DGGS) occupied by the zones being returned,
adding only once any overlaps which may occur for compact zone responses where zones are non-congruent (the total surface area is the same as what would be returned for the corresponding non-compacted list of zones
at the refinement level of the zone query).
part:: In the JSON response, for a 2D DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedAreaMetersSquare` property indicating the total surface area occupied by the zones being returned,
adding the overlaps which may occur for compact zone responses where zones are non-congruent only once.
part:: In the JSON response, For a 3D DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedVolumeMetersCube` property indicating the total volume occupied by the zones being returned, still counting overlapping regions only once.
part:: In the JSON response, For a 2D + Time DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedVolumeMetersSquareSeconds` property indicating the total volume occupied by the zones being returned, still counting overlapping regions only once.
part:: In the JSON response, For a 3D + Time DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedHyperVolumeMetersCubeSeconds` property indicating the total hypervolume occupied by the zones being returned, still counting overlapping regions only once.
====

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-json/additional-links
part:: If _DGGS Zone Data Retrieval_ is supported, the `linkTemplates` property SHOULD include an `[ogc-rel:dggrs-zone-data]` link with a `{zoneId}` variable to retrieve data from each of these DGGRS zones.
part:: The `links` property SHOULD include an `[ogc-rel:geodata]` link for zone listing pertaining to a particular collection (for <<rc_collection-dggs,Collection DGGS requirements class>>).
====

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-json/zone-order
part:: For responses where zones of multiple hierarchy levels are returned when `compact-zones` is true, the zones SHOULD be listed with coarser refinement levels first (larger zones).
====

=== Parameter `zone-level`

The following requirements describe how a client can specify the DGGRS hierarchy level at which
to retrieve the list of zones.

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-query/zone-level
description:: For specifying a level at which to return a list of DGGS zones using a `zone-level` query parameter.
part:: The Implementation SHALL support a `zone-level` query parameter for the zone query
operation (resource path ending with `.../dggs/{dggrsId}/zones`).
part:: If a compact zones list is returned (which is the default, unless the `compact-zones` parameter is set to _false_), the zones returned in the response SHALL be of the DGGRS hierarchy level specified by the `zone-level` query parameter,
or of a lower hierarchy level standing in for a compact representation of multiple zones at the requested hierarchy level.
part:: If a non-compact zones list is returned (if the `compact-zones` parameter is set to _false_), the zones returned in the response SHALL be of the DGGRS hierarchy level specified by the `zone-level` query parameter.
====

=== Parameter `compact-zones`

By default, implementations return a compact list of zones where children zones fully covering a parent
are recursively replaced by the parent zones, allowing to express large areas in a much more compact list of zones.
The following requirements describe how a client can disable returning a compact list of zones.

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-query/compact-zones
description:: For specifying whether to retrieve a list of DGGS zones using a `compact-zones` parameter.
part:: The Implementation SHALL support a Boolean `compact-zones` query parameter for the zone query
operation (resource path ending with `.../dggs/{dggrsId}/zones`), where a value of `true` corresponds to the
default behavior when the parameter is not specified, and a value of `false` disables the use of compact-zones in the response.
part:: When the `compact-zones` parameter is set to _false_, the zones list response SHALL NOT be a compact list, and SHALL explicitly list every individual zone
at the requested or default DGGRS hierarchy level.
part:: When the `compact-zones` parameter is set to _true_ (or unspecified), the zones list response SHALL be a compact list, where children zones completely covering
the area of a parent zone SHALL be replaced by that parent zone, in a recursive manner all the way to the lowest DGGRS hierarchy level.
====

=== Parameter `parent-zone` for hierarchical exploration

The following requirement describes how a client can specify a parent zone to only return zones within this parent zone,
enabling the exploration of a large list in a hierarchical manner (in combination with `zone-level`) as multiple requests and responses.

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-query/parent-zone
description:: For specifying a parent zone within which to restrict zone listing using a `parent-zone` query parameter.
part:: The Implementation SHALL support a parameter `parent-zone` zone identifier query parameter.
part:: When specified, the response SHALL NOT contain zones which are not this parent zone itself or a sub-zone of that zone.
====

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-query/zone-order
description:: Recommendation to follow the DGGRS sub-zone ordering
part:: When the `parent-zone` parameter is used, the Implementation SHOULD return a list of zones ordered according to the canonical sub-zone ordering defined by the DGGRS
(the same order used for encoding values for data retrieval in formats such as <<rc_data-json, DGGS-JSON>> relying on a shared understanding of this order by the server/producer and client/consumer).
====

=== Parameter `limit` for paging (recommendation)

The following recommendation describes how a client can specify a limit to the number of zones to be returned
and page through large list of zones as multiple requests and responses.

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-query/limit
description:: For specifying a paging limit for the list of zones using a `limit` query parameter.
part:: The Implementation SHOULD support a parameter `limit` integer query parameter, with a minimum value of 1.
part:: The response SHOULD not contain more zones than specified by the optional `limit` parameter (if specified).
part:: If the API definition specifies a maximum value for the `limit` parameter, the response SHOULD not contain more zones than this maximum value.
part:: If the value of the `limit` parameter is larger than the maximum value, this SHOULD NOT result in an error (but instead be replaced by the maximum as the parameter value).
part:: If using compact zones, the parent zones SHOULD count as a single zone, rather than the number of children zones they stand in for.
part:: If an implementation does not return the full list of zones for the request, a link with relation type `next` SHOULD be included in a `links` array property of the response,
which a client can request to resume listing the zones.
====

=== Parameter `bbox`

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-query/bbox
description:: For specifying a spatial bounding box for which to return a list of DGGS zones.
part::
+
--
The Implementation SHALL support a `bbox` query parameter for the zone query
operation (resource path ending with `.../dggs/{dggrsId}/zones`) with the characteristics defined in the OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment:

[source,YAML]
----
  bbox:
    name: bbox
    in: query
    description:
      Bounding box of the rendered map. The bounding box is provided as four or six coordinates

      * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
      * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
      * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
      * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
      * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
      * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

      The coordinate reference system and axis order of the values are indicated in the `bbox-crs` parameter or if the parameter is missing in https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84
    required: false
    schema:
      type: array
      oneOf:
      - minItems: 4
        maxItems: 4
      - minItems: 6
        maxItems: 6
      items:
        type: number
        format: double
    style: form
    explode: false
----
--
part:: `bbox` SHALL be a comma separated list of four or six floating point numbers.
If the bounding box consists of six numbers, the first three numbers are the coordinates of the lower bound corner of a three-dimensional bounding box and the last three are the coordinates of the upper bound corner.
The axis order is determined by the `bbox-crs` parameter value or longitude and latitude if the parameter is missing (https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 axis order for a 2D bounding box,
https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84h for a 3D bounding box).
For example in https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 the order is left_lon, lower_lat, right_lon, upper_lat.
part:: The returned list of zone IDs SHALL only contain zones inside or intersecting with the spatial extent of the geographical area of the bounding box.
====

=== Parameter `bbox-crs`

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-query/bbox-crs
description:: For specifying the CRS used for the `bbox` parameter using the `bbox-crs` parameter.
part:: The list of zones resource SHALL support a `bbox-crs` parameter specifying the CRS used for the `bbox` parameter.
part:: For Earth centric data, the Implementation SHALL support https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 as a value.
part:: If the `bbox-crs` is not indicated https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 SHALL be assumed.
part:: The native CRS (`storageCRS`) SHALL be supported as a value. Other conformance classes may allow additional values (see `crs` parameter definition).
part:: The CRS expressed as URIs or as safe CURIEs SHALL be supported.
part:: If the bbox parameter is not used, the `bbox-crs` SHALL be ignored.
====

=== Parameter `subset`

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-query/subset
description:: For specifying a multi-dimensional subset for which to return a list of DGGS zones.
part::
+
--
The Implementation SHALL support a `subset` query parameter for the zone query operation (resource path ending with `.../dggs/{dggrsId}/zones`)
conforming to the following Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF) fragment:

[source,ABNF]
----
  SubsetSpec:       "subset"=axisName(intervalOrPoint)
  axisName:         {text}
  intervalOrPoint:  interval \| point
  interval:         low : high
  low:              point \| *
  high:             point \| *
  point:            {number} \| "{text}"

  Where:
     \" = double quote = ASCII code 0x42,
     {number} is an integer or floating-point number, and
     {text} is some general ASCII text (such as a time and date notation in ISO 8601).
----
--
part:: The Implementation SHALL support as axis names `Lat` and `Lon` for geographic CRS and `E` and `N` for projected CRS, which are to be interpreted as the best matching spatial axis in the CRS definition.
part:: If a third spatial dimension is supported (if the resource's spatial extent bounding box is three dimensional), the Implementation SHALL also support a `h` dimension (elevation above the ellipsoid in EPSG:4979 or CRS84h) for geographic CRS and `z` for projected CRS, which are to be interpreted as the vertical axis in the CRS definition.
part:: The Implementation SHALL support as axis names `time` for a temporal dataset.
part:: The Implementation SHALL support as axis names any additional dimension (beyond spatial and temporal) as described in the `extent` property of the collection or dataset description.
part:: The Implementation SHALL return a 400 error status code if an axis name does not correspond to one of the axes of the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the data or an axis defined in the relevant `extent` property.
part:: For a CRS where an axis can wrap around, such as subsetting across the dateline (anti-meridian) in a geographic CRS, a _low_ value greater than _high_ SHALL
be supported to indicate an extent crossing that wrapping point.
part:: The Implementation SHALL interpret the coordinates as values for the named axis of the CRS specified in the `subset-crs` parameter value or in https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 (https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84h for vertical dimension) if the `subset-crs` parameter is missing.
part:: If the `subset` parameter including any of the dimensions corresponding to those of the map bounding box is used with a `bbox`, the server SHALL return a 400 client error.
part:: The Implementation SHALL interpret multiple `subset` parameters, as if all dimension subsetting values were provided in a single `subset` parameter (comma separated).
Example: `subset=Lat(-90:90)&subset=Lon(-180:180)` is equivalent to `subset=Lat(-90:90),Lon(-180:180)`
====

NOTE: A subset parameter for https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 will read as subset=Lon(left_lon:right_lon),Lat(lower_lat:upper_lat).

NOTE: When the _interval_ values fall partially outside of the range of valid values defined by the CRS for the identified axis, the service is expected to return the non-empty portion of the resource resulting from the subset.

NOTE: For the operation of returning a list of zone IDs, there normally is no value in preserving dimensionality, therefore a _slicing_ operation (using the _point_ notation) is usually equivalent to
a _trimming_ operation (using the _interval_ notation) when the low and high bounds of an interval are the same. Therefore, use of the point notation is encouraged in these cases.

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-query/subset-crs-axis-names
part:: The names of the axis SHOULD be the abbreviated names of the axis in the CRS definition (e.g. the ones defined in the EPSG database).
part:: 'e' (in lowercase), 'X' (lowercase/uppercase) or 'Easting' (lowercase/uppercase) SHOULD be interpreted as synonymous of 'E'.
part:: 'n' (in lowercase) or 'Y' (lowercase/uppercase) or 'Northing' (lowercase/uppercase) SHOULD be interpreted as synonymous of 'N'.
part:: 'Long' (lowercase/uppercase) or 'Longitude' SHOULD be interpreted as synonymous of 'Lon'.
part:: 'Latitude' SHOULD be interpreted as synonymous of 'Lat'.

description:: For specifying the CRS used for the `subset` parameter using the `subset-crs` parameter.
part:: The zone listing operation SHALL support a parameter `subset-crs` with the characteristics identifying the CRS in which the `subset` parameter is specified with a URI or safe CURIE.
part:: For Earth centric data, https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 as a value SHALL be supported.
part:: If the `subset-crs` is not indicated, https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 SHALL be assumed.
part:: The native CRS (`storageCRS`) SHALL be supported as a value. Other requirements classes may allow additional values (see `crs` parameter definition).
part:: CRSs expressed as URIs or as safe CURIEs SHALL be supported.
part:: If no `subset` parameter referring to an axis of the CRS is used, the `subset-crs` SHALL be ignored.
====

=== Parameter `datetime`

[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-query/datetime
description:: For specifying a multi-dimensional subset for which to return a list of DGGS zones.
part::
+
--
The Implementation SHALL support a `datetime` parameter expressed corresponding to either a date-time instant or a time interval, conforming to the following syntax (using link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234[ABNF]):

[source]
----
interval-bounded       = instant "/" instant
interval-bounded-start = [".."] "/" instant
interval-bounded-end   = instant "/" [".."]
interval-unbounded     = [".."] "/" [".."]
interval               = interval-bounded / interval-bounded-start / interval-bounded-end / interval-unbounded
datetime               = instant / interval
----
--
part:: The implementation SHALL support an `instant` defined as specified by link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339, 5.6], with the exception that the server is
only required to support the `Z` UTC time notation, and not required to support local time offsets.
part:: Only the zones with data whose geometry intersect with the specified temporal interval SHALL be part of the zone list response.
part:: Time intervals unbounded at the start or at the end SHALL be supported using a double-dot (`..`) or an empty string for the start/end.
part:: If a `datetime` parameter is specified requesting zone data where no temporal dimension applies, the Implementation SHALL either ignore the parameter or return a 4xx client error.
