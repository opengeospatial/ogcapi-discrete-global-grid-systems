  title: 'OGC API DGGS'
  description: >-
    WARNING - This is work-in-progress.


    The API is copied from 
    https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/aaime-sh/dggs-process/0.0.6#/DGGS%20access.


    Basic ideas:

    * The same API elements are used for a DGGS-RS service and a DGGS-Data
    service

    * In the case of a DGGS-RS service, the collections are the DGGS instances
    themselves,
      and the returned features have no properties other than the geometry and resolution
      (e.g., in GeoJSON the properties object will be ``null``)
    * In the case of a DGGS-Data service, the collections are the sample DGGS
    data (hence, made available in a particular DGGS instance, too), and the
    returned features have
      actual values associated in the ``properties`` object.

    To care for different use cases, three different output formats will be
    implemented

    for each endpoint returning cells:

    * A classic GeoJSON output, with geometry being either the boundary or the
    center
      point of the zone (to be controlled with a request parameter), for usage in classic
      GIS tools. The longitudes ill eventually be extended outside of the -180,180
      range to allow visualization by tools that cannot deal properly with dateline crossing.
    * A DGGSJSON output, small variation of the classic GeoJSON where the
    geometry is
      replaced by an array of zone-ids, to be used in both zone oriented and feature oriented
      API (e.g., the)
    * A plain array of DGGS zone ids, for cases where the attributes are not
    needed and data transfer compactness is paramount.


    Questions, discussion topics:

    * Support for multiple DDGSs, we are using rHealPix and H3, to offer the
      clients and DGGS data server at least a DGGS they are not already supporting natively
    * Is the API going to be sufficiently self describing that the clients
      can figure out everything it needs by just walking the API, or will it need specific knowledge contained in an API profile (e.g, a profile for rHeadlPix, one for H3, cosider for example zoneId and how to determine them)
    * For parametric DDGSs (e.g., rHealPix) do we expose a specific instance as
    its own DGGS, or somehow expose the full parameters of the DGGS in each
    resource?

    * This API follows a process API, where most resources are a process and one
    needs to know valid values to hit them



    CHANGES

    * 2020-07-02 initial version

    * 2020-07-23 usage of zones instead of cells everywhere, extending to
    support also data DGGS servers.

    * 2021-06-15 addition of definitions for ZoneQuery operations - Robert Gibb
    
    * 2021-10-18 Refactoring and retitling to incorporate outcomes from OGC API DGGS related implementation projects conducted during 2020 and 2021 - Matthew Purss

            This response can be references directly for every service that wants only essential information at the collections level. /collections/collectionId might return more information.
            The dataset is organized as one or more collections. This resource provides information about and how to access the collections.
            The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a link
            to other resources present (e.g. the items in the collection, path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,
            link relation `items`, a map created with data from  collection, path `/collections/{collectionId}/map`,
            link relation `map`) as well as key information about the collection.
            This information includes, but is not limited to:
            * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;
            * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate reference system (the default is always WGS84 with axis order longitude/latitude);
            * An optional title and description for the collection;
            * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from the data;

        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are
        selected.
            The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
        whether the
            coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):
  
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
            * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
            * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
            * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
            * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
            * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
  
        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84
        longitude/latitude
            (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different
        coordinate
            reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.
  
        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of
            minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude.
            However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
            (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box
        edge).
  
        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
            the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.
  
        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the
        decision of the
            server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to
        determine
            the extent or all relevant geometries.

    query-projectTo:
      name: projectTo
      description: >-
        projectTo specifies an optional reference direction, surface or volume for an operation.
        Allowed values for each direction are 0 and 1, and spatial directions may also have a value of n.
        projectTo defines a vector whose starting point is inferred as the point with each projectTo direction whose value is 1 set to 0. It takes one of three forms.
        In its one-dimensional form for specifying a reference direction, one direction has a value of 1. For example (0,0,0,1) projects to the temporal axis, and (0,0,1,0) projects to the vertical axis.
        In its two-dimensional form for specifying a reference surface, two directions have a value of 1. For example a surface at height n is specified by a projectTo value of (1,1,n,0) representing the vector [ (0,0,n,0), (1,1,n,0) ].
        In its three-dimensional form for specifying a reference volume, three directions have a value of 1. For example (1,1,1,0) projects to a spatial volume without reference to time, and (1,1,n,1) projects to a surface spanning all time at height n.
        Only the one-D\dimensional form is supported by relativePosition and relatePosition.
        While this construct could be used to implement more complex spatio-temporal queries, that isn’t the intent of Query2D, and isn’t specified for ZoneQuery either.
