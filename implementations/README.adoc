# Implementations

#work-in-progress#

This page lists software packages that implement approved or draft OGC API - DGGS standards. Draft standards are only added once they have a tagged version. Currently the following parts are covered:

Two types of software packages are distinguished:

* Server implementations are software products that can be used to set up APIs that implement OGC API - DGGS conformance classes.
* Client implementations are software products that connect to APIs implementing OGC API - DGGS conformance classes to use the feature data.


## Contribute

If you have a server or client implementation of OGC API - DGGS, we welcome a pull request to update this page to add or update an entry for the product. Please include a contact email address so that we may later contact you in case of page updates or questions.

//If you have a server product, please consider to https://www.ogc.org/resource/products/registration[register it in the OGC Product Database] and https://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine/[test it for compliance], too.

## Servers

The columns for each part list the conformance classes of the standard that are implemented by the server implementation. The conformance classes available in a specific API that is provided using the implementation will be listed in the Conformance Declaration resource (`/conformance`) of the API.

## Clients

The columns for each part list the conformance classes of the standard that the client uses when connecting to an API and the API supports that conformance class.
